Introduction file for Udemy's Deep Learning course.

Library Review:
    
    Theano - An open source efficient numeric computations library, based on numpy syntax. Useful, in that it can run on your GPU.
    
    TensorFlow - Used professionally (and in academia) to build neural networks from scratch.
    
    Keras - Based on Theano and TensorFlow. Simplifies the building of deep learning models.
